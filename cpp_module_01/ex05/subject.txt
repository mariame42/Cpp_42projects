Exercise 05: Harl 2.0
Exercise : 05
Harl 2.0
Turn-in directory : ex05/
Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, Harl.{h, hpp}, Harl.cpp
Forbidden functions : None
Do you know Harl? We all do, don’t we? In case you don’t, find below the kind of
comments Harl makes. They are classified by levels:
• "DEBUG" level: Debug messages contain contextual information. They are mostly
used for problem diagnosis.
Example: "I love having extra bacon for my 7XL-double-cheese-triple-pickle-specialketchup burger. I really do!"
• "INFO" level: These messages contain extensive information. They are helpful for
tracing program execution in a production environment.
Example: "I cannot believe adding extra bacon costs more money. You didn’t put
enough bacon in my burger! If you did, I wouldn’t be asking for more!"
• "WARNING" level: Warning messages indicate a potential issue in the system.
However, it can be handled or ignored.
Example: "I think I deserve to have some extra bacon for free. I’ve been coming for
years, whereas you started working here just last month."
• "ERROR" level: These messages indicate that an unrecoverable error has occurred.
This is usually a critical issue that requires manual intervention.
Example: "This is unacceptable! I want to speak to the manager now."

You are going to automate Harl. It won’t be difficult since he always says the same
things. You have to create a Harl class with the following private member functions:
• void debug( void );
• void info( void );
• void warning( void );
• void error( void );
Harl also has a public member function that calls the four member functions above
depending on the level passed as a parameter:
void complain( std::string level );
The goal of this exercise is to use pointers to member functions. This is not a
suggestion. Harl has to complain without using a forest of if/else if/else. He doesn’t
think twice!
Create and turn in tests to show that Harl complains a lot. You can use the examples
of comments listed above in the subject or choose to use comments of your own.
